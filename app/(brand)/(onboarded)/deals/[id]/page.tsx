/**
 * One deal, for the brand deciding whether to approve it (KAN-68, US-008,
 * AC-023, AC-024).
 *
 * `params` is a Promise and has to be awaited — the Next 16 shape, per
 * `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/dynamic-routes.md`.
 *
 * This route is what closes the loop. Wave 12 shipped `POST /approve` and
 * `POST /reject` with nothing anywhere that could call them, so every transition
 * in `fund -> deliver -> approve -> pay` existed in code while the chain could not
 * be walked in a browser. AC-023 and AC-024 both open with "given a brand reviews
 * a delivered video", which is this page.
 *
 * Lives at `/deals/[id]` rather than under `campaigns/[id]/` so the delivery
 * notification's CTA is one id deep — its payload carries a `dealId` and no
 * `campaignId`, so nesting would have meant changing the payload to build the
 * link. Inside `(onboarded)`, whose layout redirects a brand with no profile.
 *
 * Nothing here computes money. `formatEtb` is the only arithmetic-shaped call, and
 * the payout split is the ledger's to derive at approval time from the deal's own
 * snapshotted rate (invariant 8) — quoting an expected payout on this screen would
 * be a second source for a figure the transaction is about to compute.
